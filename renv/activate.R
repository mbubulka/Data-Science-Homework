# This is a placeholder for the renv activation script
# In a real project, this file would be generated by renv::init()

# The actual renv activation script would:
# 1. Set up the project library path
# 2. Configure the R session to use the project library
# 3. Load the project's dependencies from the project library

# For now, we'll just print a message
message("renv activated for project: potomac")
message("This is a placeholder. Run renv::init() to properly initialize renv.")

# In a real project, you would initialize renv with:
# if (!requireNamespace("renv", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("renv")
# renv::init()
# renv::restore()
